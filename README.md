# LV2 related Go bindings

__Important__: the packages in this directory are experimental and for development/learning purposes.  Things I consider stable & ready for use in the real world can be found at the toplevel of this organization. Like https://github.com/lvtk/go-lv2 and  https://github.com/lvtk/go-pugl for example.

See each sub directory for details
